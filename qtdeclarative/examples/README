The Qt Declarative module provides the ability to specify and implement
your user interface declaratively, using the Qt Meta-Object Language (QML). This
language is very expressive and human readable, and can be used by
designers to actually implement their UI vision. QML UIs can integrate
with C++ code in many ways, including being loaded as a part of a C++ UI
and loading data models from C++ and interacting with them.

Mostof these examples can be viewed directly with the
QML viewer utility, without requiring compilation.

Documentation for these examples can be found via the Examples
link in the main Qt documentation.
