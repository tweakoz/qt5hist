\title Porting C++ Applications to Qt 5
\brief Provides instructions to migrate a Qt 4 C++ application to Qt 5.

This topic talks about the Qt Widgets change and provides guidance to handle it.
The following step-by-step instructions takes you through the changes required
to port the \l{Animated Tiles Example}{Animated Tiles} C++ application to Qt 5:

\list 1
   \li Edit \c {main.cpp} and change the \c {#include <QtGui>} to \c {#include <QtWidgets>}.
       \note You can find a perl script called fixqt4headers in the bin directory of your Qt package that will
        automate many of the required header file changes.
   \li Edit the \c {animatedtiles.pro} and add \c {QT += widgets} towards the end of the file.
       \note QtGui is included by default in all Qt applications unless excluded using the \c {QT -= qtgui} directive in the \c{qmake} project file.
   \li Run qmake and make utilities to build the binary.
\endlist

This creates the \c animatedtiles executable. Try running the executable to see if the application behaves as expected.
