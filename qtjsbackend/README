This repository contains a copy of V8 with additional changes needed for Qt.

Please use [V8] as prefix to the subject of your commit messages when your change
affects V8 itself and not the build system around it.

Updating v8:

Run

    ./bin/update-v8.sh [url] [refspec]

to update src/3rdparty/v8 to a specific v8 version. The script will remove
all Qt specific modifications and save them in /tmp/v8_patch, where they
can be applied from using git am.

For example:

    ./bin/update-v8.sh https://github.com/v8/v8.git refs/tags/3.7.3
    git commit -e -F commitlog.txt
    git am -3 /tmp/v8_patch

In the likely case of conflicts, follow the git instructions about continuing
the patch application process after resolving the conflicts.
